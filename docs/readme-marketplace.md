# Text Dot: Color based text navigator and selector

# Quick Start
If you have a standard QUERTY layout you can start experimenting with `Text Dot` right away - press the desired shortcut and match colors containing match with key - refer to first keyboard diagram. At every step of matching there is predetermined position where will the cursor move - you can press `Esc` to confirm `Selection so far`, or match until the very last character.
- `Ctrl + F1` triggers action Text Dot: Line Selection`
- `Ctrl + F2` triggers the action `Text Dot: Column Selection`
  With this you can experiment and understand how `Text Dot` behaves in the default mode, to experiment with not only moving of the cursor but selection of text as well - instead of pressing just the key, use `shift + key`.

To learn more details of `Text Dot` including how it came to be, how it works in all of its states, how it assigns colors to keys and all the configuration options refer to the guide below. This however should be enough to get you started.
